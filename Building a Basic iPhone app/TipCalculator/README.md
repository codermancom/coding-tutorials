Curious how to build an app? In today's video I start a new series on the channel that explains programming (app and web development) to beginners. This is not a computer science series, this is coding for novices. If you already know how to build apps you may not learn much, but if you've never even opened Xcode (or know what that tool is), this video is perfect for you.
